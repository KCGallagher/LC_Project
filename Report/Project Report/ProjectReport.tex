%	ABSTRACT

\lettrineabstract{The specificity of DNA base-pair interactions gives considerable functional control in the design of anisotropic nano-particles, enabling the formation of liquid crystal phases. This project aims to study the liquid phase behaviour of such non-conventional liquid crystal molecules, with a particular focus on the novel `nunchuck' structure - two rigid rods connected via a flexible linker. The Eiser Group have previously considered intra-molecular interaction potentials at the single-nucleotide level for a single DNA nanoparticle, and I am now implementing these potentials in larger, more coarse-grained models of multiple nanoparticles, through open-source software LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). Such systems are expected to form smectic (layered) phases at high volume fractions. THIS WILL BE EDITED AT THE END}
