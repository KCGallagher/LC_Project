%	ABSTRACT

\lettrineabstract{The programmability of DNA allows us to design anisotropic nano-particles such as rods, triangles and many other shapes. Such anisotropy is a pre-requisite to form liquid crystalline structures. The exciting part is that because we can now make new shapes we expect to obtain completely new liquid crystalline symmetries. Based on oxDNA, a semi-coarse-grained, freely available simulation package that can provide the topological and stability criteria of any DNA nano-particle, the Eiser group developed a more coarse-grained model to simulate large numbers of these mesogens such that their phase-behavior can be studied.} 

%	ARTICLE CONTENTS
\section{Introduction}

In his project the student will use a cours-grained model, based on LAMMPS \cite{Xing2019}, to study the phase behaviour of ‘nunchuks’, which are two hard rods connected via a flexible linker, such that they can vary their configuration from fully stretched to folded.  Such systems are expected to form smectic (layered) phases at high volume fractions.
