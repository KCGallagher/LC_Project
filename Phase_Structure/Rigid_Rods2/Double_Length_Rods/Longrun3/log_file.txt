This run's results suggest the nematic phase is forming below the critical volume 
fraction of 0.25, occuring between 0.18 and 0.22. This is worrying and not in agreement with 
predictions from Onsager's theory; it is not clear why this has occured 'early'.

There is also uncertainty on the method of volume fraction calculation here;
as the ONsager model is based on cylindrical particles. If a smaller radius is used, the volume
fraction is reduced to the expected level, given in the subdirectory here.

Finally, we again form multiple phases in this extended simulation region; it would be preferrable 
to avoid this and so a further simulation may be attempted with a cubic region (as this extended region
may not aid director cohesion across the system).
